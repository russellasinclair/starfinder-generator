The drone does not get a full suite of actions on its own; each round, the mechanic creature and the drone can each take a move action, a swift action, and a reaction, but only one of them can take a standard action or combine its move and standard actions into a full action. The drone doesn’t have its own CR, it doesn’t contribute to the CR of the encounter, and PCs receive no XP for defeating a drone. For a mechanic creature with an exocortex, add target tracking at CR 1 (see below), wireless hack at CR 5, twin tracking at CR 10, multitasking at CR 15, and quad tracking at CR 20."
