An opponent can give itself an advantage against this ability in one of two ways.\nLooking Obliquely: An opponent that avoids looking directly at the creature's face (either by following the creature's shadow or by tracking it in a reflective surface) or that looks at the creature through a camera or heads-up display gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the saving throw. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains concealment against that opponent.\nBlocking Its Vision: By completely blocking or covering its own visual sensors, an opponent doesn't need to attempt a save against the gaze. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains total concealment against that opponent.\nGaze abilities can affect ethereal opponents but not opponents without visual sensors. A creature is immune to the gaze abilities of others of its kind unless otherwise noted. Allies of a creature with a gaze ability can still be affected, but they are always considered to be looking obliquely at the creature.\nThe creature can also veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.",

    "Description": "The creature regains Hit Points at the start of its turn, as with fast healing, but it can't die as long as its regeneration is still functioning (although creatures with regeneration still fall unconscious when their Hit Points reach 0). Certain attacks, typically those that deal acid or fire damage, cause a creature's regeneration to stop functioning for 1 round. During this round, the creature doesn't regain Hit Points and can die normally. The creature's stat block describes the types of damage that suppress the regeneration.\nRegeneration doesn't restore Hit Points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.

Creatures with stellar alignment usually have stellar revelations and zenith revelations, either ones from the solarian class or ones unique to the creature. When using stellar revelations, the creature is always considered attuned. However, it's not always considered fully attuned, so it normally can't always use zenith powers. When you roll initiative for the creature, roll 1d3. Once that many rounds have elapsed, the creature is considered fully attuned and gains access to its zenith powers. After it uses a zenith power, it's no longer fully attuned and you roll 1d3 again to see how many rounds it will take to recharge.\nIf a creature has stellar alignment (graviton) or stellar alignment (photon), it's considered to be attuned only in the indicated mode and can become fully attuned only in the indicated mode, as described above.",

  "Swallow Whole (Ex)": {
    "Description": "If the creature hits with the indicated attack (usually a bite attack), it deals the normal damage. If the creature's attack roll successfully hits the target's KAC + 4, the creature also automatically grapples the foe as part of the attack action. (If it hits the target's KAC + 13, it instead pins the target). The creature doesn't need to have a free limb to perform this grapple. Unless otherwise specified, a creature can swallow whole only targets that are at least one size category smaller than itself, and it has room for a single target of that size in its stomach (doubling the maximum number of creatures it can have swallowed for each additional size category by which these creatures are smaller).\nOn the creature's next turn after grappling or pinning the target, if the target has not escaped the grapple or pin, the target automatically takes the attack's damage at the beginning of the creature's turn. The creature can then make a new attack roll with the same attack. If it hits the target's KAC, the grapple or pin is maintained. If it hits the target's KAC + 4, the target is swallowed whole (no damage is dealt).\nOnce swallowed, the target takes the listed swallow whole damage automatically at the beginning its turn every round.\nThe target is considered grappled as long as it is swallowed.\nThe target can attempt to cut its way out (the interior of a creature with swallow whole has the same EAC as its exterior and a KAC equal to that of its exterior - 4) by dealing an amount of damage equal to one-quarter the swallowing creature's total Hit Points, though any attack that does not deal slashing damage deals only half its normal damage. If a target cuts its way out of the creature, the creature cannot use swallow whole again until that damage is healed.\nAlternatively, a target swallowed whole can attempt to climb out. The swallowed creature must succeed at both a grapple check against the creature's internal KAC + 8 and an Athletics check to climb (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 * the creature's CR).\nEach of these actions takes a full round. If both checks are successful, the target climbs back up to the creature's mouth and can escape, ending up in an open square adjacent to the creature.",

For the purpose of automatic fire, the swarm counts as five targets. For example, if an automatic attack is made using 12 rounds of ammunition, it can attack a maximum of six targets, so it can damage a swarm normally. However, if two other targets are closer to the attacker than the swarm, they must be attacked first, leaving only four attacks to target the swarm, so it takes no damage.",

  "Tracking (Ex)": {
    "Description": "The creature can use the Perception skill to perform the follow tracks task of the Survival skill with the listed sense.\nThe sense is usually related to a type of signature that most creatures leave behind, such as a scent or heat trail. The creature might gain a bonus or penalty to its Perception check to follow tracks depending on the strength of the quarry's signature, at the GM's discretion.

If the creature has a fly speed, it retains that in its whirlwind form. If it does not have a fly speed, it gains an extraordinary fly speed (with average maneuverability) equal to its base speed. A creature in whirlwind form can move freely into and through other creatures' spaces, and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity as a result of its movement.\nThe base of a creature in whirlwind form occupies a 5-foot square, and the whirlwind is twice as wide at its top as its base and has a height equal to four times the width of its base; this doesn't change the size category of the creature. If a creature is Large or larger, it can vary the size of its whirlwind form up to a maximum of a base equal to its normal space as a swift or move action. A creature in whirlwind form does not threaten any spaces around it, and it cannot make its normal attacks.\nIf a creature in whirlwind form enters the space of another creature, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save with the listed DC or take the whirlwind's listed damage. If the whirlwind covers all of the creature's space, the creature must also succeed at a Reflex save or be picked up by the whirlwind and carried along with it. A carried creature is flatfooted, grappled, and off-target, and it automatically takes the whirlwind's damage at the beginning of its turn. If the carried creature can fly, it can attempt a Reflex save as a move action, escaping on a successful save. If a carried creature does not escape, it can attempt a Fortitude save; if it succeeds, it can take any remaining actions it has on its turn (other than movement). On a failed save, the carried creature is unable to act until its next turn or until the whirlwind releases it.\nA creature in whirlwind form can carry up to two creatures of its size, with the total number it can carry doubling for every size category the affected creatures are smaller than the whirlwind. The creature in whirlwind form can eject a carried creature at any time during its turn, dropping the carried creature in a space of its choice adjacent to its position at the time of ejection.
